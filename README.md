## Description

This Prework Study Guide gave me a vision of how the bootcamp is going to look like. The assignment helped me review a lot of the things I have been learning to prepare for the bootcamp. There were a few things I wasn't aware of such as the use of terminal, but throughout I believe the whole process of the Prework Study Guide was very helpful.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The usage of the Prework Study Guide is to take notes on the lessons we learned througout the creation of the Prework Study Guide, so the main purpose and usage of it would be for students to look back into the Study Guide to further the understoodness of what we have learned.
